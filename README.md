# Mapping Earthquakes

Basil and Sadhana liked how I created my earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. Now, Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.
